# Fizzbuzz

This is my take on the Fizzbuzz assignment.

This code prints numbers 1-100, unless divisible by 3 or 5. 
If a number is divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz" instead.
If a number is divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz" instead.
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "Fizzbuzz" instead.
